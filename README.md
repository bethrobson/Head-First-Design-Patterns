# Head First Design Patterns (2014 update)

I have recently updated all the code for Head First Design Patterns to be compatible
with Java 8. This new code accompanies the 2nd edition, to be released in winter 2020.

Download the code and compile and run from the command line, or load the code into 
project in Eclipse.
